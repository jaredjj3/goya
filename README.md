## Prerequisite Goals

- make three separate counter components using:
  - react class syntax
  - react functional component/higher order components
  - react hooks

The counter component will:
- main view shows the counter's state
- increment button adds 1 to the counter's state
- decrement button subtrats 1 from the counter's state
